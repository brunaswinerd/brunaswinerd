I am a student of Systems Analysis and Development. My current technical skills include JavaScript/Node.js, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB and I’m also learning Python. I have experience with tools such as Excel and Azure DevOps.
My goal this year is to build several real-world projects. And just so you know, most of the time, I’m like this dog coding here:
